A formal proof that decisions stumps are [PAC learnable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probably_approximately_correct_learning).  

For more information, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/jtristan/stump-learnable/wiki).

## Getting it working
We assume you have [leanpkg](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/tree/master/leanpkg) installed. 

```
git clone https://github.com/jtristan/stump-learnable
cd stump-learnable
leanpkg configure
leanpkg build
```

This project only works with Lean version 3.4.2.
